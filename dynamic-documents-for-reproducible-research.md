  Learn about dynamic documents for reproducible research from Madpy and MadR.

It happens all the time: you analyze some data, making plots and fitting models, and arrange the results in a nice report to send off to your collaborators, only to find out that you weren't using the latest version of the data, and you need to redo everything you just did. Enter **dynamic documents**: a method for mixing code and prose in the same document so that entire research reports can be reproduced from raw data to finished plots with a single command. If you use dynamic documents for your data science reports, you won't waste your time repeating analyses you've already done once, and you'll find it easier to share your work with others and extend past analyses to new problems. In this session, members of the Madpy and MadR Meetups will show you how to use dynamic documents to improve the reproducibility of your data science workflows in python and R. This session will feature live coding and demos of some of the best tools for dynamic documents in the open science community, specifically Jupyter Notebooks and the RMarkdown toolchain. At the end of the session, you will be ready to dive in with dynamic documents for your own research projects.
